# Colorist

## Palette Generator and Theme Manager Plugin

🎨👨‍🎨 **Colorist** is a simple Flutter package, helping you manage all your custom theming needs from one place. Colorist is most suitable for apps with high level of UI customization, where a range of **custom-named** colors is required for easy development and design management.
